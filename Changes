  - Added accessor for week of the year, ->week
  - Implemented support for parsing of any ISO 8601 date and time of day
    in both extended and basic format. For example:

        - 00010101T000000Z      (Calender date, basic format)
        - 0001-W01-1T00:00:00Z  (Week date, extended format)
        - 0001W011T000000Z      (Week date, basic format)
        - 0001-001T00:00:00Z    (Ordinal date, extended format)
        - 0001001T000000Z       (Ordinal date, basic format)
  - Added localtime() and POSIX::strftime() to benchmark, invoking 
    Time::Moment->now is ~ 70% faster than invoking localtime().
